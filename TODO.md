# TO-DO

- [ ] Change `onCamera` and other "event" handlers to an event handler like the `addEventHandler`.
- [ ] Change `Function` type to an specified function type.
- [ ] Change math classes `Vector3`, `Vector4` and `Matrix4` to generalize functions and change all `Phoria` use of the generalized functions.
- [ ] Change the cases to use `getVector3` to support `Vector3` and `Vector4` (Only change the Types in Typescript?).
